### Overview
Immersion Stats is a React 18 side-project I built to put into practice some lessons I'm learning about writing UI's using the new (to me) modern React toolset. It reads data from a few Google Sheets that I use for tracking my Japanese language learning and presents the data in different meaningful ways.

### Developing and Deployments
- When developing locally, use `npm run start` to launch the app.
- To deploy to GitHub pages use `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy -- -m "My message"`
- To run the interactive test suite use `npm run test`
