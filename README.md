### Overview
Immersion Stats is a React 18 project I built to put into practice some lessons I'm learning about writing UI's using a modern React toolset. It reads data about my Japanese language learning from a handful of sources, including GitHub and Google Sheets, and presents the data in different, meaningful ways.
